# Skills Canada Web design and development 2023 competition 
## Task
Design and develop a web page that incorportates the them of Catholic Education Week and a student
friendly website. Use the requirements listed above in the judging evaluation. Use bootstrap 5 and XAMPP
for your database. One the attached USB you will have 3 images and content. Please layout the content and
use a navigation bar. The requirements include you must have a HOME and REGISTER tab and 2 more tabs in
the navigation bar.

## Tech stack
It's essentially using XAMPP which provides Apache, MariaDB (different version of MySQL), and PHP without much work needed to set it up. I also used Bootstrap for designing the website.

## Practice
The duration of the competition was 3 hours so I prepared a lot for the competition and manage my time while also studying during my high school. The competition only allowed using w3schools meaning that I had to make sure I knew PHP and SQL very well.
Here's my 2 repos that demonstrates what I did to practice [php-practice-v1](https://github.com/she11fish/php-practice-v1) and [php-practice-v2](https://github.com/she11fish/php-practice-v2).
Version 1 was to just get started with the tech stack since I had to learn PHP and other required tools for the first time. It took me almost 6 hours to make it.
Version 2 was the same application idea as Version 1 but I had to no longer rely on online resources. It took me now about 4 hours to make it.
